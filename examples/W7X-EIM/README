This is an example of MONKES usage for W7-X EIM geometry.
The monoenergetic coefficients are written in the file 
"monkes_Monoenergetic_Database.dat". Using the notation of MONKES paper
[Escoto, NF (2024)] (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ad3fc9)
the coefficients are K_ij*{D}_{ij} where D_{ij} are in metres 
(see equations (19), (26) and Appendix E of the paper).
