# MONKES
 Code for calculating neoclassical transport in stellarators.

The MONoenergetic Kinetic Equation Solver (MONKES) is a freely available, open-source code that calculates neoclassical transport in stellarators by solving a radially local, monoenergetic drift-kinetic equation. Details about the drift-kinetic equation and the method used to solve it can be found at [Escoto, Velasco, Calvo, Landreman and Parra, Nuclear Fusion (2024)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ad3fc9).
