In this section we will demonstrate that {\MONKES} provides fast and accurate calculations of the monoenergetic coefficients from low ($\hat{\nu}=10^{-5}$ $\text{m}^{-1}$) to high collisionality\footnote{In this context ``accurate at high collisionality'' means that the drift-kinetic equation (\ref{eq:DKE}) is solved accurately.} ($\hat{\nu}=3\cdot10^{2}$ $\text{m}^{-1}$).

In subsection \ref{subsec:Convergence} we will see that for a correct calculation of the monoenergetic coefficients for $\hat{\nu}\ge 10^{-5}$ m, $N_{\text{fs}} \lesssim  2000$ and $N_\xi \lesssim 200$ are required. In subsection \ref{subsec:Performance} it is shown that for these resolutions {\MONKES} produces fast calculations in a single processor. Finally, in subsection \ref{subsec:Benchmark} the coefficients computed with {\MONKES} will be benchmarked with {\DKES} and the code {\texttt{SFINCS}}. As a result of the benchmarking, we will conclude that {\MONKES} calculations are accurate.
