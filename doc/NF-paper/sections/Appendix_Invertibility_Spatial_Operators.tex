\section{Invertibility of the spatial differential operators}
\label{sec:Appendix_Invertibility} 
In this Appendix we will study
the invertibility of the left-hand-side of (\ref{eq:DKE_Legendre_expansion}). We are only concerned in elucidating under which conditions the algorithm given in section \ref{sec:Algorithm} can be applied to solve (\ref{eq:DKE_Legendre_expansion}). For instance, we will consider the possibility of the flux-surface being rational despite of the fact that (among other things) it may be inconsistent with the assumption that thermodynamical forces are a flux-function. We will conclude that the solution to (\ref{eq:DKE_Legendre_expansion}) submitted to (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) is unique in ergodic flux-surfaces and also on rational flux-surfaces with $E_\psi\ne 0$ and can be obtained with the aforementioned algorithm. In order to do this, we view $L_k$, $D_k$ and $U_k$ as operators that act on $\mathcal{F}$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the space of smooth functions on the flux-surface equipped with the inner product
%
\begin{align}
	\mean*{f,g}_{\mathcal{F}}=\frac{N_p}{4\pi^2}\oint\oint f\bar{g}\dd{\theta}\dd{\zeta},
	\label{eq:Fourier_inner_product}
\end{align}
where $\bar{z}$ denotes the complex conjugate of $z$ and the inner product induces a norm 
%
\begin{align}
	\norm{f}_{\mathcal{F}}:=\sqrt{\mean*{f,f}_{\mathcal{F}}}.
	\label{eq:Fourier_norm}
\end{align}
In this setting $L_k$, $D_k$ and $U_k$ are operators from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{F}$ as all of their coefficients are smooth on the flux-surface. However, the operators $L_k$ and $U_k$ given by (\ref{eq:DKE_Legendre_expansion_Lower}) and (\ref{eq:DKE_Legendre_expansion_Upper}) do not have a uniquely defined inverse. This is a consequence of the fact that the parallel streaming operator $\xi \vb*{b}\cdot \nabla+\nabla \cdot \vb*{b} {(1-\xi^2)}/{2}  \pdv*{\xi}$ has a non trivial kernel comprised of functions $g((1-\xi^2)/B)$. On the other hand, the operator $D_k$ has a unique inverse for $k\ge 1$. For $k=0$, the operator $D_0$ is not invertible as it has a kernel comprised of functions $g(B_\theta\theta + B_\zeta\zeta)$.

Whether $L_k$ and $U_k$ are or not invertible can be determined studying the uniqueness of continuous solutions (on the flux-surface) to
\begin{align}
	 \vb*{B}\cdot \nabla f + \omega_k f = s B,
	 \label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE}
\end{align}
for some $s,\omega_k\in\mathcal{F}$. Note that equations $L_k f = ks/(2k-1)$ and $U_k f =(k+1)s/(2k+3)$ can be written in the form of equation (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE}) setting, respectively, $\omega_k=(k-1)\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla \ln B /2$ and $\omega_k=-(k+2)\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla \ln B /2$. We will determine a condition for $\omega_k$ which, if satisfied, equation (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE}) has a unique solution $f\in\mathcal{F}$.

The solution to equation (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE}) can be written as
%
\begin{align}
	f = (f_0 + K ) \Phi,
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Variation_of Constants}
\end{align}
where
%
\begin{align}
	& \vb*{B}\cdot \nabla f_0 = 0,  \label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_constant}
	\\
	& \vb*{B}\cdot \nabla \Phi + \omega_k \Phi = 0,  \label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Homogeneous}
	\\
	& \vb*{B}\cdot \nabla K = {sB}/{\Phi}.  \label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Particular}
\end{align}
Equations (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Homogeneous}) and (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Particular}) are integrated (along a field line) imposing $\eval{\Phi}_{p}=1$ and $\eval{K}_{p}=0$ at a point $p$ of the field line. Note that $f_0=\eval{f}_{p}$ is an integration constant. Depending on the form of $\omega_k$, $f_0$ can or cannot be determined imposing continuity on the flux-surface. The solution to equation (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Homogeneous}) can be written as
%
\begin{align}
	\Phi = \exp(-W_k), 
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Homogeneous_solution}
\end{align}
where $\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla W_k = \omega_k$ and is integrated imposing $\eval{W_k}_{p}=0$. Note that this implies that $\Phi\ne 0$ and that 
\begin{align}
	- \vb*{B}\cdot \nabla \left(\frac{1}{\Phi}\right) + \omega_k \frac{1}{\Phi} = 0.
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Adjoint_kernel}
\end{align}
When $\Phi\in\mathcal{F}$, the left-hand side of (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE}) has a non trivial kernel (as an operator from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{F}$). In order to proceed further, we employ coordinates $(\alpha,l)$ where $\alpha:=\theta-\iota \zeta$ is a poloidal angle that labels field lines and $l$ is the length along magnetic field lines. Depending on the type of flux-surface there are two possible situations
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For ergodic flux-surfaces, $\iota\in\mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$ and satisfying (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_constant}) implies that $f_0$ is a flux-function. The solution $f$ to (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE}) is a differentiable function on the torus if $\mean*{\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla f} = 0$. Applying $\mean*{\text{Eq. (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE})}}$ combined with splitting (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Variation_of Constants}) yields
	%
	\begin{align}
		f_0\mean*{\omega_k \Phi}  & = \mean*{B s} - \mean*{K \omega_k \Phi} \nonumber
		\\
		& = \mean*{\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla(K \Phi)}. \label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Ergodic_condition}
	\end{align}
    Hence, if $\mean*{\omega_k \Phi} \ne 0$, equation (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Ergodic_condition}) fixes the value of $f_0$ so that $f$ is continuous on the torus. Note that if $\mean*{\omega_k \Phi} \ne 0$, by virtue of (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Homogeneous}), $\Phi$ is not univaluated and does not belong to $\mathcal{F}$. On the contrary, if $f_0$ is free, then $\Phi$ is a continuous function on the torus. Then, (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Ergodic_condition}) implies that $K\Phi$ is continuous on the torus when $\Phi$ is. The function $K$ is also continuous as long as $sB$ belongs to the image of $\vb*{B}\cdot \nabla + \omega_k$. Note that using (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Adjoint_kernel}) we can derive from $\mean*{\text{Eq. (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE})}/\Phi}$ the solvability condition $\mean*{sB/\Phi}=0$.
    
    \item For rational flux-surfaces, $\iota\in \mathbb{Q}$ and satisfying (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_constant}) implies that $f_0(\alpha)$ depends on the field line chosen. At these surfaces, the field line labelled by $\alpha$ closes on itself after a length $L_{\text{c}}(\alpha)$. If the solution $f$ is continuous on the flux-surface, then $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \vb*{B}\cdot\nabla f \dd{l}/B=0$ for each field line. Applying $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \text{Eq. (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE})}\dd{l}/B$ combined with splitting (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Variation_of Constants}) yields
    %
    \begin{align}
    	f_0(\alpha)
    	\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \omega_k \Phi \frac{\dd{l}}{B}  
    	& =  
    	\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} s \dd{l} - \int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \omega_k K \Phi \frac{\dd{l}}{B}
    	\nonumber 
    	\\
    	& =  
        \int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \vb*{B}\cdot\nabla(K \Phi) \frac{\dd{l}}{B}
    	. \label{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Rational_condition}
    \end{align}
    If $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \omega_k \Phi {\dd{l}}/{B} \ne 0$, condition (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Rational_condition}) fixes a unique value of $f_0(\alpha)$ (for each field line) for which $f$ is continuous on the torus. As for ergodic surfaces, if (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Rational_condition}) does not fix $f_0$, then $\Phi$ and $K\Phi$ are continuous along field lines. Again, $K$ is also continuous as long as $sB$ belongs to the image of $\vb*{B}\cdot \nabla + \omega_k$. Using (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Adjoint_kernel}) we can derive from $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}}\text{Eq. (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_MDE})}/\Phi{\dd{l}}/{B}$ the solvability condition $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}}sB/\Phi{\dd{l}}/{B}=0$.
\end{enumerate}

Thus, we have seen that when $\mean*{\omega_k \Phi}=0$ or $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \omega_k \Phi {\dd{l}}/{B}=0$, the operator $\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla + \omega_k$ from $\mathcal{F}$ to itself is not one-to-one (it has a non trivial kernel comprised of multiples of $\Phi$).  
Moreover, we have the solvability conditions $\mean*{sB/\Phi}=0$ for ergodic surfaces and $\int_{0}^{L_\text{c}}sB/\Phi\dd{l}/B = 0$ for rational surfaces. The existence of a solvability condition implies that $\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla + \omega_k$ is not onto. We can derive a simpler and equivalent condition for $\omega_k$ from (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Lk_Uk_Homogeneous_solution}). Note that $\Phi$ is continuous on the torus only when $W_k$ is. As $\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla W_k = \omega_k$, continuity of $W_k$ along field lines imposes $\mean*{\omega_k}=0$ on ergodic flux-surfaces and $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \omega_k  {\dd{l}}/{B} =0$ on rational ones. Hence, the operator $\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla + \omega_k$ is invertible if $\mean*{\omega_k} \ne 0 $ or $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \omega_k {\dd{l}}/{B} \ne 0$. 

This result can be applied to determine that $L_k$ and $U_k$ are not invertible. For both $L_k$ and $U_k$, $\omega_k \propto \vb*{B}\cdot\nabla\ln B^\gamma$ for some rational exponent $\gamma$. As $B$ is continuous on the flux-surface we have for $L_k$ and $U_k$ that $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \omega_k  {\dd{l}}/{B} =  0$ or $\mean*{\omega_k }=0$, which means that neither $L_k$ nor $U_k$ are invertible. 

Now we turn our attention to the invertibility of $D_k$ for $k\ge 1$. For $\widehat{E}_\psi =0$, $D_k$ is just a multiplicative operator and is clearly invertible when $\hat{\nu}, k\ne0$. For $\widehat{E}_\psi \ne 0$, the invertibility of $D_k$ can be proven by studying the uniqueness of solutions to
\begin{align} 
	\vb*{B}\times\nabla\psi\cdot \nabla g - \hat{\nu}_k g  = - \frac{\mean*{B^2}}{\widehat{E}_\psi} s,
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_MDE}
\end{align}
where $\hat{\nu}_k = \hat{\nu} k (k+1) {\mean*{B^2}}/{2\widehat{E}_\psi}$. The procedure is very similar to the one carried out for $L_k$ and $U_k$. First, we write the solution to equation (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_MDE}) as
%
\begin{align}
	g = ( g_0 + I ) \Psi,
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Variation_of_Constants}
\end{align}
where
%
\begin{align}
	& \vb*{B}\times\nabla\psi\cdot \nabla g_0 = 0,  \label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_constant}
	\\
	& \vb*{B}\times\nabla\psi\cdot \nabla \Psi - \hat{\nu}_k \Psi = 0,  \label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Homogeneous}
	\\
	& \vb*{B}\times\nabla\psi\cdot \nabla I = - \frac{\mean*{B^2}}{\widehat{E}_\psi}\frac{s}{\Psi}.  \label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Particular}
\end{align}
Equations (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Homogeneous}) and (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Particular}) are integrated along a integral curve of $\vb*{B}\times\nabla\psi$ imposing $\eval{\Psi}_{p}=1$ and $\eval{I}_{p}=0$ at the initial point $p$ of integration. The integral curves of $\vb*{B}\times\nabla\psi$ are, in Boozer coordinates, straight lines $B_\theta \theta + B_\zeta \zeta = \text{constant}$. In order to proceed further, we change from Boozer angles $(\theta,\zeta)$ to a different set of magnetic coordinates $(\alpha,\varphi)$ using the linear transformation
%
\begin{align}
	\Matrix{c}{\theta \\ \zeta}
	=
	\Matrix{cc}
	{
		(1 + \iota \delta)^{-1}	 &  \iota\\ 
		-\delta(1 + \iota \delta)^{-1}	 &  1
	}
	\Matrix{c}{\alpha \\ \varphi}
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Magnetic_Coordinates_Dk}
\end{align}
where $\delta = B_\theta/B_\zeta$. In these coordinates $\vb*{B} =\nabla \psi \times \nabla \alpha $, $B_\alpha = 0$ and
%
\begin{align}
	\vb*{B}\times\nabla \psi \cdot \nabla = 
	B^2 \pdv{}{\alpha}.
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Localization_alpha}
\end{align}
%
Depending on the rationality or irrationality of $\delta$ we can distinguish two options
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $\delta \in \mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$, satisfying (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_constant}) implies that $g_0$ is a flux-function (the integral curves trace out the whole flux-surface). Note that if $g$ is a differentiable function on the torus $\mean{ \vb*{B} \times \nabla \psi \cdot \nabla g } = \mean{ \nabla\times (g\vb*{B}) \cdot\nabla \psi }=0$, where we have used $\nabla\times\vb*{B}\cdot\nabla\psi = 0$. Taking $\mean*{\text{Eq. (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_MDE})}}$ assuming that $f$ is continuous on the flux-surface, combined with (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Variation_of_Constants}) gives
	%
	\begin{align} 
		\mean*{\Psi} g_0  
		& = 
		\frac{ \mean*{B^2} }{ \hat{\nu}_k \widehat{E}_\psi } 
		\mean*{s}
		- 
		\mean*{I \Psi}\nonumber
		\\
		& = 
		\frac{1}{\hat{\nu}_k}
		\mean*{\vb*{B}\times\nabla \psi \cdot \nabla(I \Psi)}. 
		\label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Ergodic_condition}
	\end{align}
    Hence, if $\mean*{\Psi}\ne 0$, continuity of $g$ on the torus fixes the integration constant $g_0$. 

    \item If $\delta \in \mathbb{Q}$, satisfying (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_constant}) implies that $g_0(\varphi)$ is a function of $\varphi$. Now the integral curves $\varphi=\text{constant}$ close on itself after moving in $\alpha$ an arc-length $L_\alpha$. In this scenario, if $g$ is a differentiable function on the torus $\int_{0}^{L_\alpha}\vb*{B}\times \nabla\psi \cdot \nabla g \dd{\alpha}/ B^2  = 0$, where we have used (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Localization_alpha}). Thus, taking $\int_{0}^{L_\alpha}\text{Eq. (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_MDE})} \dd{\alpha}/ B^2 $, combined with (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Variation_of_Constants}) gives
    %
    \begin{align}
      g_0(\varphi) \int_{0}^{L_\alpha} \Psi\frac{\dd{\alpha}}{ B^2 }
      & = 
      \frac{ \mean*{B^2} }{ \hat{\nu}_k \widehat{E}_\psi }
      \int_{0}^{L_\alpha} s    \frac{\dd{\alpha}}{ B^2 }
      \nonumber 
%      \\
%      & 
-      
      \int_{0}^{L_\alpha}   I \Psi  \frac{\dd{\alpha}}{ B^2 }
      \\
      & =       
      \frac{1}{\hat{\nu}_k}
      \int_{0}^{L_\alpha}
      \vb*{B}\times\nabla \psi \cdot \nabla(I \Psi)
      \frac{\dd{\alpha}}{ B^2 }
      .
      \label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Rational_condition}
    \end{align}
    Thus, if $\int_{0}^{L_\alpha} \Psi \dd{\alpha} / B^2 \ne 0 $ condition (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Rational_condition}) fixes the value of $g_0(\varphi)$ so that $g$ is continuous on the flux-surface. 
    
\end{enumerate}
Similarly to what happened to $\Phi$ when studying the invertibility of $L_k$ and $U_k$, continuity of the solution implies that $\Psi$ cannot be univaluated. We can write $\Psi$ as
%
\begin{align}
	\Psi = \exp(-A_k), 
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Exponential}
\end{align}
where $\vb*{B}\times \nabla\psi \cdot \nabla A_k = \hat{\nu}_k$ and is integrated along with condition $\eval{A_k}_{p}=0$. Using (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Localization_alpha}), we can write
%
\begin{align}
	A_k(\alpha,\varphi) = \hat{\nu}_k \int_{0}^{\alpha} \frac{\dd{\alpha'}}{ B^2(\alpha',\varphi)}.
\end{align}
Note that $A_k$ is monotonically crescent with $\alpha$, which means that $\Psi $ cannot be univaluated. Besides, (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Exponential}) implies $\Psi>0$, which means that $\mean*{\Psi}\ne 0 $ and $\int_{0}^{L_\alpha}\Psi   \dd{\alpha}/  B^2 \ne 0 $. Thus, there is a unique value of the constant $g_0$ which compensates the jumps in $\Psi$ and $I\Psi$ so that $g=g_0 \Psi + I \Psi$ is continuous on the flux-surface. Hence, $D_k$ is an invertible operator from $\mathcal{F}$ to itself. 


The inverse of $D_k$ for $k \ge 1$ and $\widehat{E}_\psi \ne 0$ is defined by
%
\begin{align}
	D_k^{-1} s :=  ( \mathcal{G}_0[s] + \mathcal{I}[s] ) \Psi,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{G}_0[s]$ and $\mathcal{I}[s]$ denote the linear operators which define, respectively, the constant of integration and the solution to (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Dk_Particular}) with $\eval{I}_{p}=0$ for a given source term. Specifically,
%
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{I}[s](\alpha,\varphi)
	& :=
	- \frac{\mean*{B^2}}{\widehat{E}_\psi}
	\int_{0}^{\alpha}
	\frac{s(\alpha',\varphi)}{\Psi(\alpha',\varphi)}
	\frac{\dd{\alpha'}}{ B^2(\alpha',\varphi)}  ,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{G}_0[s](\varphi)
	& :=
	\begin{dcases}
		& \text{If }\delta\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}:\\
		& \frac{2}{ \hat{\nu} k (k+1) } \frac{\mean*{s}}{\mean*{\Psi} }
		- 
		\frac{\mean*{\mathcal{I}[s] \Psi}}{\mean*{\Psi} },  
		\vspace{0.5cm} \\ 
		& \text{If }\delta\in\mathbb{Q}:\\
		& \frac{2}{\hat{\nu} k(k+1)} \dfrac{\int_{0}^{L_\alpha} s \frac{\dd{\alpha}}{ B^2 }}{\int_{0}^{L_\alpha} \Psi\frac{\dd{\alpha}}{ B^2 }}
		 -      
		\dfrac{\int_{0}^{L_\alpha}   \mathcal{I}[s] \Psi  \frac{\dd{\alpha}}{ B^2 }}{\int_{0}^{L_\alpha} \Psi\frac{\dd{\alpha}}{ B^2 }} .
	\end{dcases}  
\end{align}


Finally, we will study the invertibility of the operator $\Delta_k$ 
%
\begin{align}
	\Delta_{k} = D_k - U_k \Delta_{k+1}^{-1} L_{k+1} 
\label{eq:Invertibility_Delta}
\end{align}
assuming that $\Delta_{k+1}$ is an invertible operator from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{F}$. For this, first, we note that in the space of functions of interest (smooth periodic functions on the torus), using a Fourier basis $\{e^{\ii (m \theta+ nN_p\zeta)}\}_{m,n\in\mathbb{Z}}$, we can approximate any function $f(\theta,\zeta)=\sum_{m,n\in \mathbb{Z}} \hat{f}_{mn} e^{\ii (m \theta+ nN_p\zeta)} \in \mathcal{F}$ using an approximant $\tilde{f}(\theta,\zeta)$
%
\begin{align}
	\tilde{f}(\theta,\zeta)=\sum_{- N \le m,n\le N } \hat{f}_{mn} e^{\ii (m \theta+ nN_p\zeta)}
\label{eq:Fourier_truncated}
\end{align}
truncating the modes with mode number greater than some positive integer $N $ where 
\begin{align}
	\hat{f}_{mn} = \mean*{f,e^{\ii (m \theta+ nN_p\zeta)}}_{\mathcal{F}}  \norm{e^{\ii (m \theta+ nN_p\zeta)}}_{\mathcal{F}}^{-2}
\end{align}
 are the Fourier modes of $f$. Thus, we approximate $\mathcal{F}$ using a finite dimensional subspace $\mathcal{F}^{N} \subset \mathcal{F}$ consisting on all the functions of the form given by equation (\ref{eq:Fourier_truncated}).
 
 
 Hence, we can approximate $D_k$, $U_k$, $\Delta_{k+1}$ and $L_{k+1} $ restricted to $\mathcal{F}^{N}$ (and therefore $\Delta_{k}$) in equation (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Delta}) by operators $D_k^N$, $U_k^N$, $\Delta_{k+1}^N$ and $L_{k+1}^N$ that map any $\tilde{f}\in\mathcal{F}^N$ to the projections of $D_k \tilde{f}$, $U_k \tilde{f}$, $\Delta_{k+1} \tilde{f}$ and $L_{k+1} \tilde{f}$ onto $\mathcal{F}^N$. The operators $D_k^N$, $U_k^N$, $\Delta_{k+1}^N$ and $L_{k+1}^N$ can be exactly represented (in a Fourier basis) by square matrices of size $\dim \mathcal{F}^N$. When the operators are invertible, these matrices are invertible aswell. Doing so, we can interpret the matrix representation of $\Delta_{k}$ as the Schur complement of the matrix
%
\begin{align}
	M_k^N = 
	\Matrix{cc}
	{ D_k^N & U_k^N \\
		L_{k+1}^N & \Delta_{k+1}^N
	}.
	\label{eq:Invertibility_Delta_Schur}
\end{align}
It is well known from linear algebra that the determinant of $M_k^N$ satisfies
%
\begin{align}
	\det(M_k^N)
	& =
	\det(\Delta_{k+1}^N)
	\det(\Delta_k^N)
	.
	\label{eq:Schur_complement_determinant}
\end{align}
%
When both $D_k$ and $\Delta_{k+1}$ are invertible, the matrix $M_k^N$ is invertible. Hence, note from (\ref{eq:Schur_complement_determinant}) that, for $k\ge1$, the matrix $\Delta_{k}^N$ can be inverted for any $N$, and therefore $\Delta_{k}$ (as an operator from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{F}$) is invertible. 





%It is interesting to remark that, not all $s^{(0)}\in\mathcal{F}$ can be equalled to $D_0 f^{(0)} + U_0 f^{(1)}$ for $f^{(0)}, f^{(1)}\in\mathcal{F}$. As $D_0 f^{(0)} = - \widehat{E}_\psi \mean*{B^2}^{-1}\nabla\cdot(\vb*{B}\times \nabla \psi f^{(0)}) $ and $U_0f^{(1)} = \nabla\cdot(\vb*{b}f^{(1)})$, for any $f^{(0)}, f^{(1)}\in\mathcal{F}$ we have that $\mean*{D_0 f^{(0)}} = \mean*{U_0f^{(1)}} = 0$. Therefore, $s^{(0)}\in\mathcal{F}$ can be equalled to $D_0 f^{(0)} + U_0 f^{(1)}$ only if $\mean*{s^{(0)}}=0$. This expresses the fact that the drift-kinetic equation (\ref{eq:DKE}) preserves the number of particles in the flux-surface. Thus, the left-hand side of equation (\ref{eq:DKE}) is not an invertible operator from $\mathcal{F}\times[-1,1]$ to itself. Nevertheless, for sources with $\mean*{s^{(0)}}=0$, we still can find a solution to the drift-kinetic equation.

 	The case $k=0$ requires special care. In this case $D_0$ is not invertible and the previous argument cannot be applied. In order to make the solution unique, we need to impose an additional constraint to $f^{(0)}$. On ergodic flux-surfaces, condition (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) is sufficient to fix the value of $f^{(0)}$. However, this is not always the case when $\iota$ is rational. Condition (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) fixes the value of $f^{(0)}$ solely when the only functions that lie simultaneously at the kernels of $D_0 = -\widehat{E}_\psi \mean*{B^2}^{-1} \vb*{B}\times\nabla\psi\cdot\nabla$ and $L_1=\vb*{b}\cdot\nabla$ are constants (flux-functions). If $\widehat{E}_\psi \ne 0$, this occurs for any $\delta\ne -1/\iota $. However, the case $\delta= -1/\iota$ is unphysical as it would imply $\sqrt{g}=0$. Hence, in practice, when $\widehat{E}_\psi \ne 0$ condition (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) is sufficient to fix the value of $f^{(0)}$ even if the surface is not ergodic. For rational flux-surfaces and $\widehat{E}_\psi = 0$, condition (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) is insufficient to fix $f^{(0)}$. In such case, we would need to fix the value of $f^{(0)}$ at a point of each field line as any function $g(\alpha)$ lies in the kernel of $\vb*{b}\cdot\nabla$. In order to clarify this assertion, let's try to obtain $f^{(0)}$ assuming that $f^{(1)}$ is known. Integrating the Legendre mode $k=1$ of equation (\ref{eq:DKE_Forward_elimination}) along a field line gives
%
\begin{align}

If $\iota$ is irrational $f_0^{(0)}$ does not depend on $\alpha$. In this case, equation (\ref{eq:Invertibility_nullspace_condition}) and condition (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) fix $f^{(0)}$ for each $\sigma^{(1)}$, $f^{(1)}$. When $\iota$ is rational we need to distinguish between the case with and without radial electric field. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For $E_\psi =0$, the constant $f^{(0)}_0$ is free as no other equation includes $f^{(0)}$. As $f_0^{(0)}$ depends on $\alpha$, condition (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) does not fix this integration constant. %Demanding that the selection of $f_0^{(0)}$ does not affect the transport coefficients implies $\mean*{s_1^{(0)} f_0^{(0)}} = 0$. Note that as $\mean*{s_1^{(0)} } = 0$, we could choose $f_0^{(0)}$ to be any flux-function. 
%	
%	Note that in this case, $f^{(1)}$ does not depend on $f^{(0)}$. From equation $U_0 f^{(1)}= s^{(1)}$ we can obtain $f^{(1)}$ up to a constant $f_0^{(1)}(\alpha)$. Imposing continuity of $f_0^{(0)}(\alpha)$ at $l=L_{\text{c}}(\alpha)$ gives a condition for $f^{(1)}$ that involves only $s^{(1)}$ and $f^{(2)}$. This condition fixes the value of $f_0^{(1)}(\alpha)$ which makes $f_0^{(0)}(\alpha)$ continuous on the flux-surface. 
	%
	\item For $E_\psi \ne 0$,	
	 inserting (\ref{eq:Invertibility_nullspace_condition}) in the Legendre mode $k=0$ of equation (\ref{eq:DKE_Legendre_expansion}) gives
	 %
	 \begin{align}  
	 	& -\frac{\widehat{E}_\psi}{\mean*{B^2}}
	 	B^2 \pdv{f_0^{(0)}}{\alpha} 
	 	=
	 	s^{(0)}
	 	- U_0 f^{(1)}
	 	\label{eq:Invertibility_Integration_constant_rationals_w_Er}
	 	\\
	 	& % 
	 	-
	 	\frac{\widehat{E}_\psi}{\mean*{B^2}}
	 	B^2 \pdv{}{\alpha} 
	 	\int_{0}^{l}
	 	\left(
	 	\sigma^{(1)}
	 	- \Delta_1 f^{(1)} 
	 	\right)\dd{l'}.\nonumber
	 \end{align}
     Integrating $\int_{0}^{L_{\text{c}}} \text{ Eq. (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Integration_constant_rationals_w_Er})}\dd{l}$ gives a differential equation in $\alpha$ from which we can obtain $f_0^{(0)}$ up to a constant. Thus, (\ref{eq:Invertibility_nullspace_condition}), condition (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) and (\ref{eq:Invertibility_Integration_constant_rationals_w_Er}) fix $f^{(0)}$. 
\end{enumerate} 

Hence, in ergodic flux-surfaces or rational flux-surfaces with finite radial electric field, $M_0^N$ has a one-dimensional kernel. Thus, for $k=0$, it is necessary to substitute one of the rows of $[D_0^N \ \ U_0^N]$ by the condition (\ref{eq:kernel_elimination_condition_Legendre}) so that $M_0^N$ is invertible for any $N$ and as $\Delta_1^N$ can be inverted, also $\Delta_0^N$ constructed in this manner for any $N$, which implies that $\Delta_0$ (as the limit $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \Delta_0^N$) is invertible.
