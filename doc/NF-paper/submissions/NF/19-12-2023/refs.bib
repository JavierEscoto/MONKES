	abstract = "{Entropy production and Onsager symmetry in neoclassical transport processes of magnetically confined plasmas are studied in detail for general toroidal systems, including nonaxisymmetric configurations. It is found that the flux surface average of the entropy production defined from the linearized collision operator and the gyroangle‐averaged distribution function coincides with the sum of the inner products of the thermodynamic forces and the conjugate fluxes consisting of the Pfirsch–Schlüter, banana‐plateau, nonaxisymmetric parts of the neoclassical radial fluxes and the parallel current. It is proved from the self‐adjointness of the linearized collision operator that the Onsager symmetry is robustly valid for the neoclassical transport equations in the cases of general toroidal plasmas consisting of electrons and multi‐species ions with arbitrary collision frequencies. It is shown that the Onsager symmetry holds whether or not the ambipolarity condition is used to reduce the number of the conjugate pairs of the transport fluxes and the thermodynamic forces. The full transport coefficients for the banana‐plateau and nonaxisymmetric parts are separately derived, and their symmetry properties are investigated. The nonaxisymmetric transport equations are obtained for arbitrary collision frequencies in the Pfirsch–Schlüter and plateau regimes, and it is directly confirmed that the total banana‐plateau and nonaxisymmetric transport equations satisfy the Onsager symmetry.}",

The starting point of our optimization is a previously obtained QA stellarator with three field periods and an aspect ratio of 6. A series of QA stellarators are obtained at zero plasma beta with the varied elongation value ranging from 2.5 to 3.7. A good quasi-symmetry is kept when the elongation value is reduced from the original value of 3.7. The rotational transform profile and aspect ratio are kept fixed. The plasma volume is ether kept fixed or varied linearly with elongation. Furthermore, finite beta QA stellarators are considered. The corresponding bootstrap currents are calculated using the kinetic code SFINCS. A series of kink-stable QA stellarators are obtained via optimization with varied plasma beta up to 5\\% and self-consistent bootstrap current. This work demonstrates that good QA stellarators with finite beta and varied elongation exist that are stable to external kink modes.}",

	abstract = {Compact optimized stellarators offer novel solutions for confining  high-β plasmas and developing magnetic confinement  fusion. The three-dimensional plasma shape can be designed to enhance the  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability without feedback or nearby conducting  structures and provide drift-orbit confinement similar to tokamaks. These  configurations offer the possibility of combining the steady-state  low-recirculating power, external control, and disruption resilience of  previous stellarators with the low aspect ratio, high β  limit, and good confinement of advanced tokamaks. Quasi-axisymmetric  equilibria have been developed for the proposed National Compact Stellarator  Experiment (NCSX) with average aspect ratio 4-4.4 and average elongation  ~1.8. Even with bootstrap-current consistent profiles, they are  passively stable to the ballooning, kink, vertical, Mercier, and  neoclassical-tearing modes for β &gt; 4%,  without the need for external feedback or conducting walls. The bootstrap  current generates only 1/4 of the magnetic rotational transform at  β = 4% (the rest is from the coils); thus  the equilibrium is much less non-linear and is more controllable than  similar advanced tokamaks. The enhanced stability is a result of `reversed'  global shear, the spatial distribution of local shear, and the large  fraction of externally generated transform. Transport simulations show  adequate fast-ion confinement and thermal neoclassical transport similar to  equivalent tokamaks. Modular coils have been designed which reproduce the  physics properties, provide good flux surfaces, and allow flexible variation  of the plasma shape to control the predicted MHD stability and transport  properties.}

	abstract={The two leading concepts for confining high-temperature fusion plasmas are the tokamak and the stellarator. Tokamaks are rotationally symmetric and use a large plasma current to achieve confinement, whereas stellarators are non-axisymmetric and employ three-dimensionally shaped magnetic field coils to twist the field and confine the plasma. As a result, the magnetic field of a stellarator needs to be carefully designed to minimize the collisional transport arising from poorly confined particle orbits, which would otherwise cause excessive power losses at high plasma temperatures. In addition, this type of transport leads to the appearance of a net toroidal plasma current, the so-called bootstrap current. Here, we analyse results from the first experimental campaign of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, showing that its magnetic-field design allows good control of bootstrap currents and collisional transport. The energy confinement time is among the best ever achieved in stellarators, both in absolute figures ($\tau$E{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}100{\thinspace}ms) and relative to the stellarator confinement scaling. The bootstrap current responds as predicted to changes in the magnetic mirror ratio. These initial experiments confirm several theoretically predicted properties of Wendelstein 7-X plasmas, and already indicate consistency with optimization measures.},

The coupling of the microscopic and macroscopic physics is done within the framework of multiscale gyrokinetic theory, of which we present the assumptions and key results. An assumption of scale separation in space and time allows for the simulation of turbulence in small regions of the space-time grid, which are embedded in a coarse grid on which the transport equations are implicitly evolved. This leads to a reduction in computational expense of several orders of magnitude, making first-principles simulations of the full fusion device volume over the confinement time feasible on current computing resources. Numerical results from TRINITY simulations are presented and compared with experimental data from JET [M. Keilhacker, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 41, B1 (1999)] and ASDEX Upgrade [O. Gruber, Nucl.

	abstract = {In the present Letter, first-of-its-kind computer simulations predicting plasma profiles for modern optimized stellarators—while self-consistently retaining neoclassical transport, turbulent transport with 3D effects, and external physical sources—are presented. These simulations exploit a newly developed coupling framework involving the global gyrokinetic turbulence code GENE-3D, the neoclassical transport code KNOSOS, and the 1D transport solver TANGO. This framework is used to analyze the recently observed degradation of energy confinement in electron-heated plasmas in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, where the central ion temperature was ‘clamped’ to  keV regardless of the external heating power. By performing first-principles based simulations, we provide key evidence to understand this effect, namely the inefficient thermal coupling between electrons and ions in a turbulence-dominated regime, which is exacerbated by the large  ratios, and show that a more efficient ion heat source, such as direct ion heating, will increase the on-axis ion temperature. This work paves the way towards the use of high-fidelity models for the development of the next generation of stellarators, in which neoclassical and turbulent transport are optimized simultaneously.}

	abstract = {In transport barriers, particularly H-mode edge pedestals, radial scale lengths can become comparable to the ion orbit width, causing neoclassical physics to become radially nonlocal. In this work, the resulting changes to neoclassical flow and current are examined both analytically and numerically. Steep density gradients are considered, with scale lengths comparable to the poloidal ion gyroradius, together with strong radial electric fields sufficient to electrostatically confine the ions. Attention is restricted to relatively weak ion temperature gradients (but permitting arbitrary electron temperature gradients), since in this limit a δf (small departures from a Maxwellian distribution) rather than full-f approach is justified. This assumption is in fact consistent with measured inter-ELM H-Mode edge pedestal density and ion temperature profiles in many present experiments, and is expected to be increasingly valid in future lower collisionality experiments. In the numerical analysis, the distribution function and Rosenbluth potentials are solved for simultaneously, allowing use of the exact field term in the linearized Fokker–Planck–Landau collision operator. In the pedestal, the parallel and poloidal flows are found to deviate strongly from the best available conventional neoclassical prediction, with large poloidal variation of a different form than in the local theory. These predicted effects may be observable experimentally. In the local limit, the Sauter bootstrap current formulae appear accurate at low collisionality, but they can overestimate the bootstrap current in the plateau regime. In the pedestal ordering, ion contributions to the bootstrap and Pfirsch–Schlüter currents are also modified.}

	abstract = {It is shown that the problem of neoclassical transport at low collisionality in a perfectly quasi-isodynamic (or omnigeneous) stellarator can be reduced to the corresponding problem in a tokamak. In fact, the distribution function consists of two parts: one that can be calculated exactly (for any collision operator) and does not carry any net parallel current and one that is proportional to the total toroidal current and is determined by an equation that is identical to that solved in tokamak theory. Results from the latter can therefore be carried over to the corresponding stellarator situation. Specifically, if the total toroidal current enclosed by a flux surface vanishes, then the net bootstrap current on that surface also vanishes. It is therefore consistent to optimize a stellarator in such a way that the bootstrap current and neoclassical transport are simultaneously minimized.}

	journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
	abstract = {The theory of plasma confinement by non-axisymmetric magnetic fields is reviewed. Such fields are used to confine fusion plasmas in stellarators, where in contrast to tokamaks and reversed-field pinches the magnetic field generally does not possess any continuous symmetry. The discussion is focussed on magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium conditions, collisionless particle orbits, and the kinetic theory of equilbrium and transport. Each of these topics is fundamentally affected by the absence of symmetry in the magnetic field: the field lines need not trace out nested flux surfaces, the particle orbits may not be confined, and the cross-field transport can be very large. Nevertheless, by tailoring the magnetic field appropriately, well-behaved equilibria with good confinement can be constructed, potentially offering an attractive route to magnetic fusion. In this article, the mathematical apparatus to describe stellarator plasmas is developed from first principles and basic elements underlying confinement optimization are introduced.}

	title = {The effect of tangential drifts on neoclassical transport in stellarators close to omnigeneity},
	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {In general, the orbit-averaged radial magnetic drift of trapped particles in stellarators is non-zero due to the three-dimensional nature of the magnetic field. Stellarators in which the orbit-averaged radial magnetic drift vanishes are called omnigeneous, and they exhibit neoclassical transport levels comparable to those of axisymmetric tokamaks. However, the effect of deviations from omnigeneity cannot be neglected in practice, and it is more deleterious at small collisionalities. For sufficiently low collision frequencies (below the values that define the  regime), the components of the drifts tangential to the flux surface become relevant. This article focuses on the study of such collisionality regimes in stellarators close to omnigeneity when the gradient of the non-omnigeneous perturbation is small. First, it is proven that closeness to omnigeneity is required to actually preserve radial locality in the drift-kinetic equation for collisionalities below the  regime. Then, using the derived radially local equation, it is shown that neoclassical transport is determined by two layers located at different regions of phase space. One of the layers corresponds to the so-called  regime and the other to the so-called superbanana-plateau regime. The importance of the superbanana-plateau layer for the calculation of the tangential electric field is emphasized, as well as the relevance of the latter for neoclassical transport in the collisionality regimes considered in this paper. In particular, the role of the tangential electric field is essential for the emergence of a new subregime of superbanana-plateau transport when the radial electric field is small. A formula for the ion energy flux that includes the  regime and the superbanana-plateau regime is given. The energy flux scales with the square of the size of the deviation from omnigeneity. Finally, it is explained why below a certain collisionality value the formulation presented in this article ceases to be valid.}

	abstract={Research on magnetic confinement of high-temperature plasmas has the ultimate goal of harnessing nuclear fusion for the production of electricity. Although the tokamak1 is the leading toroidal magnetic-confinement concept, it is not without shortcomings and the fusion community has therefore also pursued alternative concepts such as the stellarator. Unlike axisymmetric tokamaks, stellarators possess a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field geometry. The availability of this additional dimension opens up an extensive configuration space for computational optimization of both the field geometry itself and the current-carrying coils that produce it. Such an optimization was undertaken in designing Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)2, a large helical-axis advanced stellarator (HELIAS), which began operation in 2015 at Greifswald, Germany. A major drawback of 3D magnetic field geometry, however, is that it introduces a strong temperature dependence into the stellarator's non-turbulent `neoclassical' energy transport. Indeed, such energy losses will become prohibitive in high-temperature reactor plasmas unless a strong reduction of the geometrical factor associated with this transport can be achieved; such a reduction was therefore a principal goal of the design of W7-X. In spite of the modest heating power currently available, W7-X has already been able to achieve high-temperature plasma conditions during its 2017 and 2018 experimental campaigns, producing record values of the fusion triple product for such stellarator plasmas3,4. The triple product of plasma density, ion temperature and energy confinement time is used in fusion research as a figure of merit, as it must attain a certain threshold value before net-energy-producing operation of a reactor becomes possible1,5. Here we demonstrate that such record values provide evidence for reduced neoclassical energy transport in W7-X, as the plasma profiles that produced these results could not have been obtained in stellarators lacking a comparably high level of neoclassical optimization.},

It is shown that these methods can be derived from the drift kinetic equation with the same collision model used for correctly taking account of collisional momentum conservation. In both methods, the Laguerre polynomials of the energy variable are employed to expand the guiding-center distribution function and to obtain the moment equations, by which the radial neoclassical transport fluxes and the parallel flows are related to the thermodynamic forces. The methods are given here in the forms applicable for an arbitrary truncation number of the Laguerre-polynomial expansion so that their accuracies can be improved by increasing the truncation number. Differences between results from the two methods appear when the Laguerre-polynomial expansion is truncated up to a finite order because different weight functions are used in them to derive the moment equations. At each order of the truncation, the neoclassical transport coefficients obtained from the Sugama–Nishimura method show the Onsager symmetry and satisfy the ambipolar-diffusion condition intrinsically for symmetric systems. Also, numerical examples are given to show how the transport coefficients converge with the truncation number increased for the two methods.}",

Since the collisional momentum conservation is properly retained, the well-known intrinsic ambipolar condition of the neoclassical particle fluxes in symmetric systems is recovered. Thus, these resultant neoclassical diffusion and viscosity coefficients are applicable to evaluating accurately how the neoclassical transport in quasi-symmetric toroidal systems deviates from that in exactly symmetric systems.}",

The main feature of KNOSOS is that it relies on orbit-averaging to solve the drift-kinetic equation very fast. KNOSOS treats rigorously the effect of the component of the magnetic drift that is tangent to magnetic surfaces, and of the component of the electrostatic potential that varies on the flux surface, φ1. Furthermore, the equation solved is linear in φ1, which permits an efficient solution of the quasineutrality equation. As long as the radially local approach is valid, KNOSOS can be applied to the calculation of neoclassical transport in stellarators (helias, heliotrons, heliacs, etc.) and tokamaks with broken axisymmetry. In this paper, we show several calculations for the stellarators W7-X, LHD, NCSX and TJ-II that provide benchmark with standard local codes and demonstrate the advantages of this approach.}

Plasmas 24 082516) is used for the first time to study scenarios with considerable bootstrap currents for the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Bootstrap currents in the range of tens of kAs can lead to the formation of unwanted magnetic island chains or stochastic regions within the plasma and alter the boundary rotational transform due to the small shear in W7-X. The latter issue is of relevance since the island divertor operation of W7-X relies on a proper positioning of magnetic island chains at the plasma edge to control the particle and energy exhaust towards the divertor plates. Two scenarios are examined with the new free-plasma-boundary capabilities of SIESTA: a freely evolving bootstrap current one that illustrates the difficulties arising from the dislocation of the boundary islands, and a second one in which off-axis electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) is applied to compensate the effects of the bootstrap current and keep the island divertor configuration intact. SIESTA finds that off-axis ECCD is indeed able to keep the location and phase of the edge magnetic island chain unchanged, but it may also lead to an undesired stochastization of parts of the confined plasma if the EC deposition radial profile becomes too narrow.}

The magnetic field of a quasi-symmetric stellarator at high plasma pressure is significantly affected by the bootstrap current, but the computational cost of accurate stellarator bootstrap calculations has precluded use inside optimization. Here, a new efficient method is demonstrated for optimization of quasi-symmetric stellarator configurations such that the bootstrap current profile is consistent with the geometry. The approach is based on the fact that all neoclassical phenomena in quasi-symmetry are isomorphic to those in axisymmetry. Therefore, accurate formulas for the bootstrap current in tokamaks, which can be evaluated rapidly, can be applied also in stellarators. The deviation between this predicted parallel current and the actual parallel current in the magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium is penalized in the objective function, and the current profile of the equilibrium is included in the parameter space. Quasi-symmetric configurations with significant pressure are thereby obtained with self-consistent bootstrap current and excellent confinement. In a comparison of fusion-produced alpha particle confinement across many stellarators, the new configurations have significantly lower alpha energy losses than many previous designs.}",
